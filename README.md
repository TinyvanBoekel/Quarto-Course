# Quarto-Course
Files related to a Quarto course given at Wageningen University &amp; Research (WUR)
This repository contains a reader about how to use Quarto for scientific articles and how to compile them into a PhD thesis. The three short mock articles serve as an example; course participants (mainly PhD students) build such articles to learn the ins-and-outs of Quarto as a tool to practice Open en Reproducible Science.
